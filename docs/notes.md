# Notes

## PCB Design

### MCU Bus Allocation
PORTA: ADC for sensors
PORTB: Control interface
PORTC: JTAG
PORTD: USART

### XBee Pins
The course coordinator will make a USB-XBee interface board for flashing firmware onto the XBee module. Thus the module should be removable from the design, or its pins accessible to an external board as to allow for future flashing with updated software.
